    Welcome to the dawning days of storybots: programs that write stories so humans don t have to. Bots now write simple stories about softball games, corporate earnings reports, the weather and, yes, earthquakes. Some of them are extraordinarily simple -- basic programming knowledge is all that s required. Others are quite sophisticated -- they rely on more complex tools to arrive at a simple story.

    How we communicate is changing rapidly and fundamentally. Because the delivery of journalism has been largely unchanged for lengthy periods of time – newspapers for hundreds of years, television and radio for less – there’s been little experimentation with the fundamental delivery of news and information. But the web sets fire to many of the foundations of media delivery systems. Gone are the days of needing millions of dollars for presses, trucks, antennae, FCC licenses, etc. Now, anyone with an idea and the will to make it can be a media mogul. This class is going to be about building new forms of communication, with respect to the past and a sprint into the future.

    The best reporters harness the right tools to get the story. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information -- to do investigative reporting. We’re going to get our hands dirty with spreadsheets, databases, maps, some basic stats and, time permitting, some stuff I’ll call “serious future s**t.” And in the end, we’ve got a project to produce. So buckle up and hold on.

    "An introduction to the ways in which the computer and data technologies can be partners in creative practices. We will emphasize writing code over point-and-click interfaces, presenting the computer as a programmable object. Through a series of projects, students will move from exploratory sessions, to writing small programs, to sharing code with others in class. They will learn by making, and in the process master a scripting language like Python or Ruby. Projects will examine and extend existing technologies in the digital humanities, computational journalism, architecture, and design and will likely deal in text and images, in human relationships as exhibited through social networks, in map-making and in reporting."

    This course considers both the scientific and social implications of counting, turning the world into bits. Students will learn human protocols (census and survey, interview, crowdsourcing, and experiments) and computer- or computer-assisted strategies and tools for collecting data. These distinctions will prove useful whether students collect data on their own, or access data collected and published by other organizations. Students will then spend time thinking through representations of core data types like time, location, text, image, sound and relationships (or networks), and the computational affordances associated with each. They will study common metaphors for organizing and storing data — from structureless key-value stores, to relational databases. We will also discuss ideas behind publishing or sharing data, moving from HTML documents and Web 1.0, to data services and APIs in Web 2.0, to semantics in Web 3.0. These efforts will be project-driven, using and building modern data services with a scripting language. Projects will underscore the reality that data are plentiful and circulate and interact in an informational ecosystem. As researchers, students will be called on to access and publish data products.

    Consideration of both the scientific and social implications of counting, of turning the world into bits. Through the process of gaining fluency in the use of Python, students will spend some time thinking through representations of core "data types" like time, location, text, image, sound and relationships (or networks), and the computational "affordances" associated with each. Students will study several common metaphors for organizing and storing data – from structureless key-value stores, to document collections like MongoDB, to a single table or spreadsheet, to the "multiple tables" of a relational database. We will also discuss ideas behind publishing or sharing data, moving from HTML documents and Web 1.0 to data services and APIs in Web 2.0, to semantics in Web 3.0. These efforts will be project-driven, with students using and building modern data services with a scripting language.

    Algorithms are at the heart of computer processing - they are descriptions of computation. We will present a basic taxonomy of algorithms based on their purpose and discuss complexity (will an algorithm take a lot of time or require significant system resources?). Classes will be anchored around several algorithms developed for or by the digital humanities, computational social science, computational journalism, architecture, and other fields. Examples might include some aspect of natural language processing, computer vision, or statistical/machine learning. Students will learn a process of questioning computation and its artifacts, of examining an algorithm and assessing its capabilities and its biases: How does it function? What are its implicit assumptions? How should we test its operation? What does it leave out? In the process, students will also learn best practices for writing, documenting and publishing algorithms and code.

    This course begins with the idea that computing tools are the products of human ingenuity and effort. They are never neutral and carry with them the biases of their designers and their design process.  Platform studies  is a new term used to describe investigations into these relationships between computing technologies and the creative or research products that they help to generate. How you understand how data, code, and algorithms effect creative practices can be an effective first step toward critical thinking about technology. This will not be purely theoretical, however, and specific case studies, technologies, and project work will make the ideas concrete.

    The economics of digital publishing technology have opened a floodgate of raw data, and journalism is just one of many fields that are being rapidly transformed by that floodgate. In law, medicine, business, politics, and ecology, people are using data to understand the social and natural worlds. They are also using data to tell stories.

    To retain their position as brokers of trust and hubs of community conversation, reporters must understand how the people they cover are using data, and how journalists can use data to improve our shared understand of an increasingly complex world. Your decision to take this course indicates that you are interested in learning the skills an concepts of data-driven reporting. My expectation is that you already have demonstrated clear news judgment and precise, brief storytelling either in or out of a classroom. The class starts from the assumption that you’ve never or rarely used even a basic spreadsheet to aid either your reporting or storytelling. That’s where the semester will begin. We will end just shy of an introduction to how computer programming and algorithms are using journalistic data to create new editorial products.

You will learn how computer spreadsheet and database programs can be used to find details, leads and stories in collections of electronic records. With the proper training and inclination, journalists who are comfortable with these tools can produce stories that would be virtually impossible to do otherwise. Though this approach to reporting has roots that stretch back decades, only in recent years has it moved beyond being an exotic curiosity. As the tools have become more affordable and accessible, success stories have proliferated, prompting greater demand for training and for reporters who can do this work.

The course is built around a “design” frame that examines technology from the point of view of its possible applications and social context.

    It will familiarize the students with both the major unsolved problems of internet-era journalism, and the major areas of research within computer science that are being brought to bear on these problems. The scope is wide enough to include both relatively traditional journalistic work, such as computer-assisted investigative reporting, and the broader information systems that we all use every day to inform ourselves, such as search engines. The course will provide students with a thorough understanding of how particular fields of computational research relate to products being developed for journalism, and provoke ideas for their own research and projects.

But just as reporters a century ago discovered they couldn’t live without those newfangled phones and typewriters, today’s reporters cannot live without computers. Those machines, along with traditional shoe- leather reporting, let journalists generate stories they couldn’t produce easily (or at all) just a few years ago.

    In “legacy” media, newspaper and magazine journalists had no need to learn how to operate the printing presses, or to understand strategies the marketing and circulation departments used to promote and distribute their work. Their interactions with readers were one-sided at best, antisocial at worst. And computers were treated as glorified typewriters. The Internet blew that world up. Mobile technologies and social media are shaking it yet again. This course explores the mind-sets and skill-sets of journalism in the digital age.

    This is a skills-based, capstone course designed to enhance reporting skills, primarily by identifying and analyzing electronic data to look for patterns and trends that can lead to in-depth news stories. Students will obtain and analyze digital data for computer-assisted reporting that can be published on various media platforms Students will use spreadsheets and databases to manage information, find news stories, and produce graphics. Although students will spend a great deal of time learning how to use Microsoft Excel and Access software, this is not a class about computer programs; it s a class about good reporting practices. Learning the software is just one way to become a better reporter.

    The objective of this course is to familiarize students with digital tools that will become the frameworks with which they can approach storytelling, emphasizing the use of structured data and the visualization of data to aid in the understanding of complex information. The course establishes a deep understanding of the basic principles with which government collects and distributes information, with an emphasis on a new set of tools, dubbed Gov. 2.0, that’s allowing the public greater access to and interaction with data than ever before.

    Students will use visualization tools to find the story hidden in the data and then apply that by determining the most appropriate platform for storytelling that will engage an audience. The course will highlight emerging database tools and familiarize students with how to design interfaces that can differentiate their reporting. While students will examine a variety of government data, they will spend most of their time working with data involving politics and the 2010 Census. These will be obtained from a variety of sources official and unofficial. The final project described below will encompass some or all of the datasets we work with in class, but the students will choose their own areas of focus.

    The world that we live in and report on is increasingly influenced by data. This course will help you use data to find and develop stories that can’t be found in other ways. Data can be anything: spreadsheets full of numbers, the text of speeches or the measured observations of daily life. Reporters need to be able to treat data as another source to be researched, interviewed and analyzed, using the right tool for the job. Beginning with spreadsheets and continuing to databases, basic mapping and rudimentary programming, this class will make working with data a part of your skill set. This is a skills-based course, so students will need to be comfortable with learning to use computer software beyond word processors. If you are wondering if you can do this stuff, you can. You may prefer interviewing people to data, but avoiding data - particularly for Washington journalists - is no longer an option."

     In this class, we will practice data journalism, a technique that is also called computer-assisted reporting. Also called precision journalism, this reporting strategy uses computers to analyze the ever-increasing amount of publicly available data to create unique and compelling stories. This course will teach the fundamentals of such techniques and combine your analysis of publicly available data into a semester-long enterprise reporting project. You will create a story, or a series of stories, that spring from the records you analyze.

    This is a class in computer-assisted reporting, a branch of the data journalism movement. In previous incarnations of the class, Maurice Tamman of Reuters dubbed it the “empirical spine” of journalism in the tradition of Philip Meyer’s Precision Journalism. Whatever the name, the idea is the same: original reporting and analysis in the service of stories, particularly in the investigative and enterprise genres.

    Using records in electronic form gives you a powerful way to document patterns no one else has seen or sought. It changes your interviews from fact-gathering exercises to explanations and illumination. It can help you confirm or disprove a tip, isolate anecdotes and mash up sources for exclusive stories. Best yet, a computer doesn’t complain when you ask new questions and only lies when you make a mistake or misunderstand.

The course introduces students to the techniques of computer-assisted reporting. The course will show students how to use primary, secondary and human sources and analyze the data that will become the basis for asking questions in stories.

    The data analysis is only the beginning; students then need to determine the meaning of information and show readers how it affects them. Students will have an opportunity to conduct searches using published materials, government documents, archives, electronic databases, public records, personal interviews and the Internet. Students will learn how to critically analyze information gathered in their searches, to put it in context, to measure biases and to gauge accuracy. The course will emphasize sifting through information, selecting the most valuable material, providing context and understanding of that information, and presenting it in a clear and accurate way for purposes of a news story.

    This course is about evaluating and executing social science research. Journalism professionals increasingly need to analyze, interpret and use research methods employed in the social sciences. Knowledge of these methods is increasingly important for informing audiences about the findings of research in areas such as crime, political campaigns, welfare reform, government operations, race relations and many others. Journalists must decipher and judge claims based upon social science research. In addition, journalists are frequently called upon -- as in the case of "civic journalism" and computer assisted reporting projects -- to generate original research as part of news coverage. Participants in this course will learn some of the fundamental lessons needed to fulfill these responsibilities well.

    The course involves reading, discussion and exercises. The first part of the term is devoted to learning the language and logic of research, including research ethics, study design, measurement and data gathering, sampling and statistical inference, and the use and misuse of statistics. In addition, during this period students will learn and practice the use of spreadsheet software to analyze data.

    Public records have been the mainstay of good beat and investigative reporting for years. But times are changing. No longer are records stored in dusty file drawers or shelves, but rather on the optical disks, hard drives and tapes of mainframe and desk top computers. Soon, paper records may well disappear and all records will be stored as electronic images or database files. If we re to continue doing our jobs, we will have to know the ins and outs of these systems.

    Records in electronic format are also, in may ways, more useful to the clever reporter. By utilizing database searching and analyzing techniques, we can use public records in ways we couldn t use paper records. No longer are you the victim of a filing system that organizes data in ways that are not useful to you (say alphabetically). Now you can sort records by those attributes that are important ot you for a particular story (say chronologically, by magnitude or geographically).

    With these more sophisticated tools, journalism has crossed the line into the field of social science. Journalists run regression analyses to determine how race plays a factor in lending or how neighborhood income plays a factor in neighborhood test scores.

    The purpose of this course is to provide a framework and a reference point for you to build upon. In essence, it is to help you help yourself. This will be done with heavy doses of both the theoretical and the practical. My intent is to demystify computers and data and, hopefully, make students aware of how much fun this can be.

    Doing journalism — high-quality journalism — involves five phases that I call the RRAW-P process : Research, Reporting, Analysis, Writing and Publishing (or Production).  This is a four-unit course designed to develop and reinforce your skills in the first three of these, especially as they pertain to the digital information environment.  By the end of the semester, however, you will be demonstrating your skills in the fourth aspect of the process, writing.

    In this course you will be learning a lot about how to search for, retrieve, manage and analyze data.  Often that data will be in digital form but ink-on-paper data is still a major part of the research for most stories.   During the first week or two, we will be doing some practical — and I hope fun  — activities to get you up-to-speed in the basic skills and tools related to today’s communications environment.  I'm talking about sophisticated computer tools.  We also will learn about the basics of Analytic Journalism (aka computer-assisted reporting): online research and data management tools, some sophisticated aspects of spreadsheets and, possibly, get into the basics of databases and geographic information systems (GIS).   You will also be expected to know some elementary statistics.  As the semester progresses, you will be doing more basic research into public documents, research often related to your final project.

    A major component of the public relations practitioner’s work is to find and utilize facts, figures and opinions in a thoughtful and productive manner. Successful practitioners can observe and examine an array of information ranging from consumer perceptions to voting trends and spending habits and, in turn, draw useful conclusions. This course is designed to introduce students to the research and evaluation tools available to them as tomorrow’s public relations practitioners. The goal of the class is to produce professionals who understand the need to measure and evaluate all communications efforts. Students will leave the course prepared to evaluate assignments they encounter as professional practitioners; find, interpret, synthesize and present research, to direct a research project, and to package and present research.

    We are swimming in data - "Big" and small, global and personal. And we are also facing complicated problems like Climate Change and inequality whose stories can only be told with data. The need for public understanding of data-driven issues is higher than ever before. But raw data doesn't make a good story and that's where you come in.

    This class is focused on how to tell stories with data to create social change. We will learn through case studies, examples and hands-on experimentation with tools and technologies. We will teach basic methods for research, cleaning and analysis of datasets, but the focus in on creative methods of data presentation and storytelling. We will consider the emotional, aesthetic and practical effects of different presentation methods as well as how to develop metrics for assessing impact. For the final project, students will create a piece that tells a data-driven story.

    The world is awash with increasing amounts of data, and we must keep afloat with our relatively constant perceptual and cognitive abilities. Visualization provides one means of combating information overload, as a well-designed visual encoding can supplant cognitive calculations with simpler perceptual inferences and improve comprehension, memory, and decision making. Furthermore, visual representations may help engage more diverse audiences in the process of analytic thinking.

    In this course we will study techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualization tools and systems.

  description: |
    Today, the world is awash in unprecedented amounts of data and an expanding network of sources for news. Media organizations today must be able to put data to work quickly. This need was amply demonstrated during Hurricane Sandy, when public, open government data feeds became critical infrastructure. The open question is not whether data, computers, and algorithms can be used by journalists in the public interest, but rather how, when, where, why, and by whom. Today, journalists can treat all of that data as a source, interrogating it for answers as they would a human. That work is data journalism, or gathering, cleaning, organizing, analyzing, visualizing, and publishing data to support the creation of acts of journalism. A more succinct definition might be simply the application of data science to journalism, where data science is defined as the study of the extraction of knowledge from data.

  description: |
    JRN-STA 380 explores the quality of how quantitative ideas and material are represented in daily journalism—where, in fact, most of us get our common-sense ideas about the numbers and data present in our everyday lives. The topics for the course are ripped from current events and headlines—especially those numbers and data related to political polling, the financial crisis, and energy/environmental issues. In analyzing the numbers that underlie such current news stories, we dig under the surface of a USA Today graph or a CNN poll to give students the chance to critique contemporary journalism’s use of numerical representations. In the course we examine and critique concepts such as journalistic objectivity and bias, the concept of uncertainty, and various visual presentations of numerical data.

    We also give students opportunities to craft their own articles on related topics, some of them tied to course speakers and/or Miami faculty who have expertise in political polls, financial systems, and environmental sustainability. For selected speakers, students will “cover” their lectures and write -- as individuals and in groups --their own news stories. In turn, their stories will be critiqued, not only by course faculty, but by the lecturers themselves to see how well students presented complex numeracy in their journalistic representations. The course, useful to students in any major, advances in-depth critical thinking, promotes clear communication, and teaches compelling storytelling about complex topics. Finally, the course aims to help students understand numbers in a way that helps them become more discerning media consumers, more perceptive journalistic critics, and more actively engaged citizens in democratic life.

    J502 is concerned with the collection, analysis and interpretation of data in the pursuit of news. As such, this is not just a skills course. Certainly, you will get an overview of lots of digital tools to find stories in data. But more importantly, this course emphasizes how to think about, contextualize and write about the data we encounter all around us. You will generate your own quantitative analyses of data we obtain, but you will also learn to critically evaluate data analysis by others, such as scientists and interest groups. You will gain an understanding of important statistical concepts, perspective on how social science techniques can serve a journalists, and working knowledge of how to obtain data and conduct analyses using tools such as spreadsheets and databases. While this course is aimed at establishing a working journalist’s competency with data, the skills and concepts you learn will be useful in practically any branch of mass communication you choose.

    The computer gives journalists access to a whole new range and realm of sources. A reporter in Des Moines who needs to gather data on food production in China can do so easily by using a variety of electronic research tools. The San Jose journalist trying to understand her city's budget no longer is bound by the analysis of the city manager's office; with her spreadsheet, she can explore the spending patterns, see which departments consistently gain and which consistently lose in the city's budget politics. By using databases, journalists can connect pieces of information from disparate sources and dig deeper to gain meaning from vast amounts of data.

    Every day, more of our lives is being stored in a database somewhere. With that explosion of data, journalists now more than ever need the skills to analyze and understand data to then produce the stories hidden in the information. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information -- to do investigative reporting. We’re going to get our hands dirty with spreadsheets, databases, maps and some basic stats. And we're going to do journalism. So buckle up and hold on.
